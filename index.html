                <h2>Water for Plants and Oxygen</h2>
                <p>Water conservation is necessary for plants to have photosynthesis, growth, and reproduction of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Plants use some water as their chemical makeup, and the rest is for their reproduction of oxygen. The oxygen that is reproduced is necessary for human life because humans need oxygen to breathe. Plants use water moisture in soil for growing crops. For instance, US potatoes require soil moisture levels of 25% to 50%; alfalfa, 30% to 50%; and corn, 50% to 70% (Pimentel et al. 2004). Rice in China requires at least 80% soil moisture (Pimentel et al. 2004).</p>

                <h2>Productive Soils and Erosion</h2>
                <p>Since the world’s food comes from productive soils, erosion of these soils decreases the productivity of the world’s foods by reducing the availability of water to the soils, diminishing soil nutrients, soil biota, soil organic matter, and decreasing soil depth (Pimentel et al. 2004). Reducing available water for soils is the most harmful effect of erosion because eroded soil absorbs 87% less water than uneroded soil through infiltration. A yearly water runoff rate of about 30% which carries sediments, nutrients, and pesticides from agricultural fields into ocean water and groundwater is the leading cause of source pollution in the United States (EPA 2002). When erosion removes topsoil and organic matter, it intensifies water runoff, decreasing crop yields.</p>

                <h2>Untreated Water and Diseases</h2>
                <p>Untreated water from lakes, rivers, oceans, aquifers, reservoirs, and groundwater lack sanitation and treatment to make it safe for drinking, bathing, and washing. Untreated water is a cause of serious human infections and diseases, which contributes to approximately 12 million deaths each year worldwide, primarily among infants and young children (Hinrichsen et al. 1998). For example, tuberculosis infects about 2 billion people worldwide, either through direct penetration of their skin, or use of contaminated water or food (Hotez et al. 1996).</p>

                <h2>Loss of Biodiversity</h2>
                <p>Green water is a term used to describe the water necessary for keeping natural ecosystems and plants functioning to maintain a productive environment for humans and other organisms. For instance, in 2002, approximately 33,000 salmon were killed when farmers had to withdraw increased volumes of water for irrigation (Pimentel et al. 2004). Furthermore, overpumping and upstream removal of water has reduced biodiversity in the Colorado River and the Rio Grande (Pimental et al. 2004). As a result, 45 species of plants and animals were listed as endangered or threatened (Glenn et al. 2001).</p>

                <h2>Climate and Environmental Change on Water Availability</h2>
                <p>Global climate change, or buildup of carbon dioxide, methane gas, and nitrous oxide in the atmosphere is a factor that can cause water shortages because of changes in precipitation and temperature patterns in the world (Downing and Parry 1994, IPCC 2002). Changes in water availability will affect agriculture, forestry, biodiversity, and human activities. For instance, if California faces a 50% decrease in mountain snowpack because of climate change, it will change the timing and intensity of surface water flow (Pimentel et al. 2004), leading to water shortage. In addition to climate change, it increases temperatures, declines rainfall, and evaporation rates increase, causing less food production (Pimentel et al. 2004). With less food production, the amount of water needed to grow food will increase by about 30% (Doll 2002).</p>

                <h2>Ways of Water Conservation</h2>
                <p>Conserving water worldwide is important for maintaining crops, livestock, forest production, and preventing floods for everyone, including farmers and the public. One way to conserve water is to find ways to make the process of soil absorbing water easier. For example, trees and shrubs conserve and slow water runoff by 10% to 20%, before water reaches streams, rivers, and lakes (Pimentel et al. 2004). Additional strategies for conserving water for crop production are adjusting water application needs to specific crops, preventing the removal of biomass from land, using water delivery systems, like drip irrigation for efficient crop watering, and collecting runoff water in cisterns and ponds.</p>
