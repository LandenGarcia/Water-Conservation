                <h2>Water for Plants and Oxygen</h2>
                <p>Water conservation is necessary for plants to have photosynthesis, growth, and reproduction of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Plants use some water as their chemical makeup, and the rest is for their reproduction of oxygen. The oxygen that is reproduced is necessary for human life because humans need oxygen to breathe. Plants use water moisture in soil for growing crops. For instance, US potatoes require soil moisture levels of 25% to 50%; alfalfa, 30% to 50%; and corn, 50% to 70% (Pimentel et al. 2004). Rice in China requires at least 80% soil moisture (Pimentel et al. 2004).</p>

                <h2>Productive Soils and Erosion</h2>
                <p>Since the world’s food comes from productive soils, erosion of these soils decreases the productivity of the world’s foods by reducing the availability of water to the soils, diminishing soil nutrients, soil biota, soil organic matter, and decreasing soil depth (Pimentel et al. 2004). Reducing available water for soils is the most harmful effect of erosion because eroded soil absorbs 87% less water than uneroded soil through infiltration. A yearly water runoff rate of about 30% which carries sediments, nutrients, and pesticides from agricultural fields into ocean water and groundwater is the leading cause of source pollution in the United States (EPA 2002). When erosion removes topsoil and organic matter, it intensifies water runoff, decreasing crop yields.</p>
