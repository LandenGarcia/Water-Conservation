                <h2>Pools and Spas</h2>
                <p>During the summer season, most water wastes happen in people’s yards at their homes because of evaporation, leaks, and spillage from pools and spas. There are a variety of ways that help save water from pools and spas.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A pool or spa cover is a method of reducing its evaporation by 95%.</li>
                    <li>To reduce backwashing, prevent leaks, and save water, use an automatic pool cleaner or replace a DE filtering system with a cartridge filter that does not require backwashing.</li>
                    <li>Hot tubs and pools need to be drained only if it has a water quality problem or if it needs to be repaired. Water in spas or hot tubs need to be changed 2-3 times yearly, and need to incorporate new water cleaning technology.
                    </li>
                    <li>To add more water lost to evaporation or refill in spas and pools, use captured rainwater. When draining a hot tub, let it sit for 48-72 hours without adding chemicals, then use the water on garden plants.
                    </li>
                    <li>Don’t use waterfalls, fountains, or other water features in pools, in order to reduce water loss and evaporation.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Grass and Lawns</h2>
                <p>Grass uses twice as much water as most other plants in one’s yard. One way for one’s lawn to be taken care of, with less water required is to remove the lawn. Removing one’s lawn is beneficial because their yard will require very little maintenance and care, it will promote soil health and a healthy ecosystem, mowing the lawn will not be needed, and it saves money for the water bill. One of the most common ways to remove a lawn, or kill grass is through herbicide, which is a chemical that kills weeds or plants, and is the fastest way to remove grass. Another way is using a sod cutter, which is a machine that removes grass with a blade, extracting large amounts of sod.</p>

                <h2>Compost and Mulch</h2>
                <p>Incorporated compost into soil and application of compost or mulch onto the soil surface is a way to conserve water because it improves the soil’s physical, chemical, and biological properties, increases aggregate stability, infiltration rates, water holding capacity (WHC), hydraulic conductivity, plant available water (PAW), and reduces bulk density. Compost into soil improves its biological properties by providing organic fuel to soil organisms. Increases in water-holding capacities in soil is associated with increases in soil organic matter. For instance, NRCS estimates that one percent organic matter in the top six inches of soil holds about 27,000 gallons of water per acre. Furthermore, 23.5 tons of compost with 50% organic matter is required to increase SOM by 1% to an average depth of 20 cm. A method of estimating the effect of compost on available water capacities is by using data on the percentage of organic matter in the compost to be applied and determining the application rate. Research by CalRecycle on water runoff from fire-damaged soils discovered that incorporation of compost into soil reduced water runoff at a rate of more than 60 gallons per ton of compost. Available water capacities (AWC) of soil depend on soil texture and soil organic matter content.  Loamy soils have the highest AWC while coarse sand and gravel have the lowest.</p>
